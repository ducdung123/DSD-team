                        queens at a family-run homestay, sustainable accommodations present countless ways to
                        connect with Vietnam’s nature, culture and people, in a way that creates a <a
                            href="https://vietnam.travel/sustainability">positive impact</a>.
                        Vietnam is not known for a sustainable focus, but you may be surprised to know that there
                        are eco-friendly, socially responsible places to holiday sprinkled up and down the country.
                        Here are some standouts to get you started.</h2>

                    <p>The <a href="https://vietnam.travel/places-to-go/southern-vietnam/mekong-delta">Mekong
                            Delta's</a> sunny skies and marvelous rivers are best enjoyed in the company of
                        others. Let <a href="https://www.mekongrustic.com/mekong-rustic-can-tho-rl2.html">Mekong
                            Rustic's</a> smiling locals be your hosts for your Delta adventure.
                        Positioned in Can Tho and Cai Be, this outfit works with local communities to develop
                        accommodations and low-impact tours that show how the Vietnamese actually live in the Delta.
                        Whether you choose the homestay option or the bungalows, you’ll be warmly welcomed with
                        delicious fruits, shown around fruit farms, canals and fish ponds, and fed abundant,
                        nourishing meals, morning, noon and night.</p>

                    <h3>Topas Ecolodge, Sapa &nbsp;</h3>
                    <p>It is hard to pinpoint the highlight of a stay at <a href="https://topasecolodge.com/">Topas
                            Ecolodge</a>.
                        The incredible food? The
                        infinity pool? The ever-changing valley views? Or maybe it’s the trekking among rice
                        terraces and ethnic minority villages. Suffice to say, there are numerous good reasons to
                        visit, but the best is the positive impact the Topas group is making in this part of Lao Cai
                        Province. By employing more than 100 people from ethnic villages, buying produce from nearby
                        farmers, and carefully managing its waste, water, and energy resources the lodge has set a
                        benchmark for sustainable stays within Vietnam.</p>
                    <h3>Lak Tented Camp, Dak Lak&nbsp;</h3>

                    <p><img src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/vietnam%20camping.jpg"
                            alt=""></p>

                    <p>Enjoy having nature to yourself? Then you’ll love discovering <a
                            href="https://www.laktentedcamp.com/destination-lak/">Lak Tented
                            Camp</a>. This glamping
                        site is perched on the banks of Lak Lake, an hour from the airport in Buon Ma Thuot. A short
                        boat ride takes you to the dock, where you’ll be welcomed inside a restored M’nong stilt
                        house, and shown your tent. Each of the 15 tents features a porch overlooking the lake, and
                        is equipped with comfy beds, handsome furniture, and ethnic pieces. Apart from providing
                        jobs to local communities and preserving ethnic minority culture via its tours and design,
                        Lak Tented Camp also grows its own food on site, purifies fresh water from shallow wells,
                        and heats it using solar power. Bravo!</p>

                    <h3>Mango Bay, Phu Quoc &nbsp;</h3>

                    <p>Don’t let the fun name fool you. <a href="http://mangobayphuquoc.com/">Mango
                            Bay</a> is serious about at least one thing: protecting
                        the environment. This barefoot chic resort on the island of Phu Quoc has taken up the baton
                        as a custodian of the island’s tropical treasures. The resort’s operations include best
                        practices such as composting and on-site water purification; however Mango Bay goes a step
                        further with its long-term reef rehabilitation and tree-planting projects, and even conducts
                        biodiversity surveys on Phu Quoc in partnership with Wildlife At Risk. If that isn’t enough
                        for a feel-good getaway, just wait until you see the resort’s on-the-rocks beach bar and
                        gorgeous garden bungalows.</p>

                    <hr />
                    <h3>Victoria Mekong, Mekong Delta&nbsp;</h3>

                    </p>

                    <p>Sustainable cruising has arrived in the Mekong Delta. Launched in late 2019, <a
                            href="https://www.victoriamekong.com/">Victoria Mekong</a> is undertaking a different sort
                        of experience
                        in Delta. Yes, its Jacuzzi pool, private
                        cinema and floating spa are all fabulous, however it’s the ship’s environmentally friendly
                        operations that make it stand out from the rest. Step aboard and you’ll find plastic-free
                        staterooms, a freshwater generator, solar heating panels, sewage treatment plant, and
                        state-of-the-art engines for maximum fuel efficiency coupled with minimum noise and
                        emissions. Each itinerary includes star attractions in the Delta’s riverside towns, as well
                        as cultural excursions to lesser-known gems.</p>

                    <hr />
                    <h3>Pu Luong Retreat, Pu Luong&nbsp;</h3>


                    <p>Ah, Pu Luong! Even the name sounds refreshing. Nestled amid lovely rice terraces, bubbling
                        streams and tidy ethnic villages, <a href="https://puluongretreat.com/">Pu Luong Retreat</a>
                        Retreat capitalizes on the area’s restorative
                        qualities. The owners hired local carpenters to create each structure and space using
                        natural materials found in the area, and made existing trees part of the resort’s design.
                        Beautiful balconies face a misty panorama of hills and paddies, and the retreat’s rock
                        garden, chemical-free infinity pool and stilt houses blend harmoniously with the
                        surroundings. If you feel like exploring, hike or bike nearby trails to see waterfalls and
                        ethnic villages, or try bamboo rafting along the river.</p>

                    <hr />
                    <h3>Savanna Villa, Hoi An &nbsp;</h3>
                    <img src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/vietnam%20green%20travel-2.jpg"
                        alt="">

                    <p>Little Hoi An is famously known for its UNESCO-listed Ancient Town and beguiling
                        lantern-strung streets. Away from the tourist hangouts, the local community in An My village
                        goes about life in much the same way as always: farming, fishing, gardening, rearing
                        animals, and raising family. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Savannahoian/">Savanna Villa</a>
                        makes this tranquil daily life the theme of its
                        private villa concept. Built to world-class sustainable standards, Savanna’s villas
                        incorporate natural airflow, solar heating, wastewater treatment, and are plastic-free.
                        Planted with local trees and flowers, these villas not only look great on Instagram, they
                        also help Hoi An retain its countryside charm.</p>

                    <hr />
                    <h3>Caravelle Hotel, Ho Chi Minh City</h3>

                    <p>One of the most storied properties in Ho Chi Minh City, the <a
                            href="https://www.caravellehotel.com/">Caravelle</a> is a perfect example
                        of an established city hotel committing to positive change. The Caravelle was the first
                        property in Vietnam to receive Earthcheck’s Gold Certification in 2015, and has held onto
                        that status ever since by meeting the industry’s best benchmarks for daily operations. All
                        rooms are lit with LED lights, check in is paper-free, and water refill stations are located
                        on each floor. Even more endearing, the hotel’s staff regularly stage clean-ups, fun runs
                        and even flash mobs to raise awareness around climate change.</p>

                    <hr />
                    <h3>Bhaya Cruises, Ha Long Bay and Lan Ha Bay</h3>
                    <img src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/vietnam%20green%20travel.jpg"
                        alt="">

                    <p>There’s nothing more dreamy than an overnight cruise on <a
                            href="https://vietnam.travel/places-to-go/northern-vietnam/ha-long">Ha
                            Long Bay</a>… that is, except for a
                        two-night cruise in Ha Long Bay and Lan Ha Bay. This extraordinary place is under threat,
                        which is why it’s great to see <a href="https://www.bhayacruises.com/">Bhaya Cruises</a> taking
                        a stance to protect its natural beauty.
                        Bhaya operates with a ‘zero single-use plastic’ policy, diversifies its guests away from
                        over-visited attractions, and hosts an annual clean-up event to remove trash from Ha Long’s
                        limestones islets. Churning through ancient seascapes and stopping at hidden caves, Bhaya’s
                        cruises are simply magical.</p>
