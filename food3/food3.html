        <h2>If you only have one day in <a href="https://vietnam.travel/places-to-go/southern-vietnam/ho-chi-minh">Ho
                Chi Minh City</a>, spend the day eating. Vietnam's most dynamic city is filled to the brim with good
            food. People from all over Vietnam come to Ho Chi Minh City to work, bringing with them recipes from their
            hometowns that over time make up the metropolis’ exciting culinary scene. Here's our insider guide to three
            dishes you don't want to miss.</h2>

        <hr />
        <h3>Broken rice equals a wholesome breakfast</h3>
        <p><img alt="eat like a local HCMC" data-entity-type="file"
                data-entity-uuid="324c76c9-781e-49b2-a1ce-986586595041"
                src="https://vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/what%20to%20eat%20HCMC%20Vietnam%20Travel-3.JPG" />
        </p>

        <p>Ask anyone in Ho Chi Minh City and they will tell you the go-to breakfast here is cơm tấm (broken rice). Cơm
            tấm is one of the few dishes that <a
                href="https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/vietnam-foodie-guide-region">originated in Ho Chi Minh
                City</a>. In the old days, these special broken rice grains were not fit for sale, so farmers would save
            and eat them. In fact, the tấm rice grains are so symbolic of humble beauty and grace that in the Vietnamese
            version of Cinderella, she was named Tấm whereas the evil stepsister was called Cám, after a different kind
            of rice byproduct.</p>
        <p>Cơm tấm has all the right stuff to kickstart your day: honey-glazed barbecued pork chops, sunny-side-up eggs,
            spring onions, and pickled papaya on a bed of rice. Of course, these days you can have cơm tấm for any
            meal.&nbsp;Everyone in Ho Chi Minh City has his or her favourite cơm tấm spot, but don’t be afraid to try
            out the one closest to you. It will likely be just as good. Pour a generous amount of sweet fish sauce on
            top of everything on your plate, and dig in.</p>

        <h3>Snails, skewers, and seafood &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
        <img src="https://vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/what%20to%20eat%20HCMC%20Vietnam%20Travel.JPG"

        <p>The area of District 4 is known for its many sidewalk BBQ seafood and snail joints. The small street of Vĩnh
            Khánh (District 4, Ho Chi Minh City) comes to life just after dark. Around 6pm, it transforms into a
            bustling neighbourhood, filled with diners gathering for a beer over some snails and seafood skewers,
            weekdays and weekends alike. For foodies who want to immerse in the lively atmosphere of Ho Chi Minh City,
            head to the restaurants along Nhiêu Lộc – Thị Nghè Canal (bờ kè area), a branch of the Saigon River that
            runs through the city.</p>

        <p>While snails may sound foreign to some, they are one of the city’s most famous specialties. Snail
            restaurants lay out fresh catches of the day in baskets or trays for you to choose from. They can go up
            to twenty different kinds. From stir-fried with butter and garlic, grilled with sea salt and chilli, to
            stewed in coconut milk, each way of cooking snails pairs perfectly with each type of snail. Sweet
            snails, cockles, and razor clams are some local favourites. Overwhelmed by these selections? Simply ask
            what the other diners are eating and they will be happy to help you.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>The many faces of hủ tiếu &nbsp;</h3>

        <p><img alt="banh mi sandwich" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b1a2dac6-73d5-44ee-b758-06d3845c99a0"

        </p>

        <p>Because of its culturally diverse population, countless versions of a single dish are a common theme in the
            local food scene. Few dishes are as representative of this city as <a
                href="https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/beyond-pho-5-awesome-vietnamese-noodles">hủ tiếu</a>. It has
            multiple origins (Chinese, Cambodian, and Vietnamese), and has seen many changes and adaptations, yet it's
            embraced by Vietnamese everywhere.&nbsp;You can easily find a hearty bowl of hủ tiếu Nam Vang (Phnom Penh
            rice noodles) with thin strings of rice noodles submerged in boiling hot bone broth, topped with shrimp,
            pork, quail eggs, and fried garlic on small carts all over the city.</p>

        <p>An alternative you don’t want to miss is hủ tiếu Sa Đéc, originated from the former Sa Đéc province in the
            Mekong Delta. This flavourful noodle dish comes with a special sweet sauce, a taste signature to the Delta
            region. As you bite into the rice noodle strings, you will notice the difference in their chewy texture. A
            plate of mung bean sprout and lettuce adds a cheerful crunch to every bite.</p>

                    mì</i></b><b data-stringify-type="bold"> like no other&nbsp;</b></h3>
        <img src="https://vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/eat%20like%20a%20local%20HCMC-2.jpg" alt="">
        <p>You can find <i data-stringify-type="italic">bánh mì</i> anywhere in Vietnam, but each region puts its own
            twist on the classic sandwich. In Ho Chi Minh City, a typical <i data-stringify-type="italic">bánh mì</i>
            comes with char siu pork, homemade paté, soft butter, pickled papaya, and hot chili peppers. Some cooks make
            their own special sauce that magically ties everything together.</p>

        <p>Bánh mì Huỳnh Hoa is a firm favourite among locals. Known for their generous fillings and spectacular
            flavours, the small shop always has a line of dedicated diners waiting in front, no matter what time of day.
            Each one sets you back 42,000 VNĐ, and is almost twice as big as your average <i
                data-stringify-type="italic">bánh mì</i>. But size is not the only thing that sets Huỳnh Hoa apart.
            Every wonderful bite contains equal measures of all the fantastic tastes and textures. In the words of the
            Huỳnh Hoa's owner: “This is no ordinary <i data-stringify-type="italic">bánh mì</i>!”&nbsp;</p>

        <h3><b data-stringify-type="bold">Summertime spring rolls</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

        <p><img alt="Vietnamese sandwich" data-entity-type="file"
                data-entity-uuid="edd9961a-960c-4946-8068-a863e6022caf"

        <p>For Vietnamese who grew up in Ho Chi Minh City, <i data-stringify-type="italic">gỏi cuốn</i> (fresh spring
            rolls) are the food of childhood. Many of us would have these spring rolls on the sidewalks as an
            after-school snack. You can easily get a taste of this wrap at street food vendors around the city. Pull up
            a plastic stool, order a plate of <i data-stringify-type="italic">gỏi cuốn</i>, and see for yourself what
            makes this simple dish so special.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Freshness is at the heart of <i data-stringify-type="italic">gỏi cuốn</i>. Green lettuce and herbs are
            wrapped around rice noodles, steamed pork, and a single prawn. The simplicity highlights each ingredient's
            pure flavours. However, the difference between a great <i data-stringify-type="italic">gỏi cuốn</i> and a
            mediocre one lies in its dipping sauce. The thick fermented sauce can be an acquired taste, but give it a
            try and you will see where <i data-stringify-type="italic">gỏi cuốn</i> gets its boldness. After hours of
            exploring the city, some <i data-stringify-type="italic">gỏi cuốn</i> and iced tea is perfect for a break.
            Not to mention, these beautiful rolls will definitely spice up your Instagram feed.&nbsp;<br />
