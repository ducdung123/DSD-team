        <p>Coffee has long been a key agricultural product in Da Lat, but more recently, inspired entrepreneurs are opening a door for visitors to learn more about the area’s coffee growing history. For a morning you won’t forget, hitch a ride out to the <a href="http://www.khocoffee.com/kho-coffee" class="ext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>K’Ho Coffee Farm and Roastery</strong><span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a>, to see how speciality heirloom Arabica is grown and processed sustainably by a community of ethnic K'Ho farmers.</p>
        
        <p><img alt="Stop and smell the coffee" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c103fa0f-a7e5-46a4-b9fd-701d4430a501" src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/top%20things%20to%20do%20in%20dalat-11.jpg"></p>
        
        <p>Closer to town,<strong> <a href="https://laviet.coffee/?fbclid=IwAR3GwQPWT4Ym1Kl3qJGYUU_BcS_Th3l3CSyuyOh0sVr98D9G1nx6Onk-cUo" class="ext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">La Viet<span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a> </strong>captures the cool new spirit of Da Lat in their industrial-style warehouse-slash-cafe. After a smooth cup of your choice, take a free tour of the roasting labs. For coffee drinkers who prefer to keep it old school, or just want to encounter the Da Lat of the past, the fading decor and retro atmosphere at <strong>Cafe Tung</strong> will take you back at least a few decades.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Explore peaceful pagodas&nbsp;</h3>
        
        <p><img alt="Explore peaceful pagodas" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3d49dc7c-ce6b-4832-b72c-e155cba483b1" src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/top%20things%20to%20do%20in%20dalat-18.jpg"></p>
        <p>Even if you’re not normally a temple goer, Da Lat’s hilltop pagodas are wonderful attractions in their own right. While tourists crowd to take pictures at the iconic Linh Phuoc Pagoda, inside the city you’ll find a quieter gem in <strong>Linh Son Pagoda</strong>. This elegant pagoda sits on a small hill at 120 Nguyen Van Troi. Dating to 1940, the pagoda’s serene corridors and courtyards are open to the praying public. Just be sure to dress modestly.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><img alt="Explore peaceful pagodas" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3d49dc7c-ce6b-4832-b72c-e155cba483b1" src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/best%20things%20to%20do%20in%20dalat.jpg"></p>
        <p>Another worthwhile&nbsp;stop is <strong>Truc Lam Temple</strong> on Phuong Hoang Hill. Created in the Zen buddhist tradition established by Tran Dynasty King Tran Nhan Tong, who abdicated his throne to become a monk, the compound has private quarters for the sangha and public areas open to visitors. Wander through fragrant flower gardens and ceremonial halls, or find a seat in the shade of a pine tree overlooking Tuyen Lam Lake.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Eat on the street&nbsp;</h3>

        <p><img alt="Eat on the street" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ad53e457-bc8a-4e26-b237-bd9de7e9e1a2" src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/6Z3A0427.jpg"></p>
        <p>Pull up a seat. The fertile farms all around make Da Lat home to some of the freshest fruits and vegetables in the country. Anyone can eat well by joining the locals at the buzzing eateries on the street. Originally populated by ethnic minorities, Da Lat is known for tweaking and enhancing the dishes of its migrant population, rather than creating its own original dishes.</p>

        <h3>Stay somewhere special&nbsp;</h3>

        <p><img alt="Stay somewhere special" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ad53e457-bc8a-4e26-b237-bd9de7e9e1a2" src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/dalat%20hostels.jpg"></p>

        <h3>Shop the central market&nbsp;</h3>

        <p><img alt="Shop the central market" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ad53e457-bc8a-4e26-b237-bd9de7e9e1a2" src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/top%20things%20to%20do%20in%20dalat-12.jpg"></p>
        <p>Artichokes, avocados, asparagus — Da Lat supplies the rest of Vietnam with produce best grown at altitude. The city’s largest market is a focal point for commerce: a bustling, multi-level building smack in the centre of town. Deep inside the market on the upper floor cooks assemble bowls of vibrant <strong><em>mì Quảng&nbsp;</em></strong>noodles and other local dishes all day long. Below, stalls overflow with plump, brightly coloured fruits and vegetables.</p>
        <p><img alt="Shop the central market" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="422fb101-294d-47eb-832b-765d161de800" src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/best%20things%20to%20do%20in%20dalat-3.jpg"></p>
        <p>Inside the market, whole rows are dedicated to&nbsp;clothes and fabrics. On its&nbsp;fringes, flower sellers, phở stalls, and dried goods vendors spread side-by-side&nbsp;along the pavement. If you're looking for something to bring home, you'll be surorunded by shops Da Lat's famous preserved fruits, candied ginger, coffee and artichoke tea.&nbsp;Time your visit in the early morning for an eye-popping look around.</p>

        <h3>Check out colonial relics&nbsp;</h3>

        <p><img alt="Check out colonial relics" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ad53e457-bc8a-4e26-b237-bd9de7e9e1a2" src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/dalat%20inside%20guide-5.jpg"></p>
        <p>If you're a fan of art-deco architecture, you’ll have a field day roaming the roads and boulevards of Da Lat, where Indochine-era villas squat in a state of charming disrepair. French urban planners designed Da Lat as a holiday town for colonialists and elite Vietnamese, complete with health complexes, golf courses, and parks. Many hotels and residences in Da Lat still reflect turn-of-the-century trends in France, melded with a few local flourishes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><img alt="Check out colonial relics" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="422fb101-294d-47eb-832b-765d161de800" src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/best%20things%20to%20do%20in%20dalat-2.jpg"></p>
        <p>The <strong>Domaine de Marie</strong> Catholic church and convent is a good place to start. If you can get in, the former <strong>Lycée Yersin</strong> (now a teachers’ college) has a trove of striking structures on campus. Another option is to swing by for afternoon tea at the <a href="https://www.dalatpalacehotel.com/" class="ext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Dalat Palace Hotel</strong><span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a>. Opened in 1922, the property’s sweeping views and grand interiors still echo the days when it was a favourite playground for colonial officials and their families.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Spend time along the lake&nbsp;</h3>

        <p><img alt="Spend time along the lake" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ad53e457-bc8a-4e26-b237-bd9de7e9e1a2" src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/dalat%20itinerary.jpg"></p>
        <p>Da Lat’s lakes are inseparable from its&nbsp;image as a romantic haven for honeymooners. Coupled or not, the paths bordering <strong>Xuan Huong&nbsp;Lake </strong>are an excellent spot to catch a glimpse of local daily life, stop for tea, or break a sweat with a jog along the water’s edge. Not far from the city centre, another manmade body of water lures nature lovers.</p>
        <p><img alt="Spend time along the lake" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="422fb101-294d-47eb-832b-765d161de800" src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/What%20to%20do%20in%20Dalat-6.jpg"></p>
        <p><strong>Tuyen Lam Lake </strong>is a 350-hectare oasis of placid beauty, encircled by pines and shrouded in fog mists many days of the year. Make the most of this dreamy setting with a spin around the lake, or take a boat or kayak on the water to chart your own course.</p>
