                    <h2>Go just a few hours outside of Hanoi, and you’ll find another world, one that can be dreamy,
                        dramatic, and enriching all at once. After taking in the whirlwind of sights, tastes and sounds
                        in the capital, it’s good to spend a day in the countryside, getting in touch with the nature
                        and culture of Northern Vietnam. Whether you head west to the ocean, east to the mountains or
                        set off for a nearby national park, you’ll be glad you made the effort. Here are five easy
                        destinations to explore from Hanoi.</h2>

                    <hr />
                    <h3>A relaxing retreat: Mai Châu</h3>
                    <img src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/day%20trips%20from%20Hanoi.jpg"
                        alt="">
                    <p>In Northwestern Vietnam, a three and a half-hour drive from the city takes you into the mountains
                        of Hoà Bình. Here you’ll find the peaceful valley of Mai Châu, nestled close to the border with
                        Laos. With a mountain range hugging it all around, Mai Châu is a great choice for laid-back
                        nature lovers looking to cycle through quiet rice paddy fields, enjoy authentic cultural
                        experiences and devour scrumptious home-cooked meals. Spend a day visiting the valley, or stay
                        the night in a Tày stilt house and catch a live dance performance and sunrise over the rice
                        paddies.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3>A once-in-a-lifetime cruise: Hạ Long Bay</h3>
                    <img src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/Hanoi%20daytrips-6.jpg"
                        alt="">
                    <p>One of Vietnam’s most famous attractions sits right on Hanoi’s doorstep. Hạ Long Bay, and its
                        less well-known neighbours (Bái Tử&nbsp;Long Bay and Lan&nbsp;Hạ Bay), are just two hours
                        outside of the city. For a convenient day trip to this UNESCO World Heritage site, leave the
                        capital at the crack of dawn. That way you can spend the day cruising in the sunshine, soaking
                        up the magnificent landscape, exploring historic caves or kayaking in the jade waters.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>TIP: <strong><a href="https://www.bhayacruises.com/1-day-halong-bay-cruises">Bhaya
                                Cruises</a></strong> -- a leader in sustainable cruising in Vietnam -- offers a
                        comprehensive one-day excursion to Hạ Long Bay, including delicious meals and smooth transfers
                        from Hanoi. Their traditional junk boats and smiling staff will make your Hạ Long outing
                        unforgettable.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>A day in the countryside: Ba Vì</h3>
                    <img src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/day%20trips%20from%20Hanoi%20%282%29.jpg"
                        alt="">

                    <p>An hour and a half from the capital, Ba Vì National park is a great gulp of fresh air. The rural
                        hamlets and pastoral scenes on the way let you know you’ve definitely left the capital behind,
                        and the park itself is full of bubbling brooks, lush jungle and lofty hills. Hike up one of the
                        three peaks, where you’ll find a temple for national hero Ho Chi Minh and abandoned French
                        military outposts. A soothing soundtrack of exotic birds, insects and frogs will keep you
                        company at all times. <a
                            href="https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/5-reasons-try-homestay-vietnam">Homestays</a> and
                        hotels are available in and near the park if you choose to stay the night.</p>

                    <h3>A journey through history: Ninh Bình</h3>
                    <img src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/Ninh%20Binh.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>What do a World Heritage Site, Vietnam’s biggest pagoda, and the country’s oldest national park
                        have in common? They can all be found in <a
                            href="https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/10-must-do-activities-ninh-binh">Ninh Bình</a>, a
                        province just two and a half hours southwest of Hanoi. Ninh Bình can be seen in a day but be
                        sure to arrange your tour in advance for a seamless experience. Float down a maze of waterways
                        below epic karsts in Tràng An, before hiking up a hill to the epic viewpoint at Hang Múa. Don’t
                        miss a visit to Hoa Lư, the ancient capital of the north, to discover the history of this area.
                        If you want to extend your stay, kick back at a homestay enveloped by karsts in Tam Cốc.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>TIP: <strong><a href="https://sensasia.com/asia-travel/vietnam/tours/">SensAsia</a></strong>
                        offers one day and multi-day tours of this charming province with the expertise of a local guide
                        and comfort of a private transfer. If you choose to combine several destinations in the north,
                        look into their bespoke multi-day tours from Hanoi to Mai Châu, Ninh Bình and&nbsp;Hạ long Bay.

                    <h3>A spiritual adventure: Perfume Pagoda</h3>
                    <img src="https://www.vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/Hanoi%20travel.jpg" alt="">

                    <p>In Vietnam, nature and culture are often intertwined, as the most beautiful areas were often
                        chosen as sites for shrines, tombs, and palaces. This is the case at Perfume Pagoda, a series of
                        pagodas and shrines set within the mouth of a cave just two hours from Hanoi. You’ll find the
                        beauty of this destination not only in the sacred temple grounds but also in the journey there.
                        Drifting along Yến stream, climbing the steps to the cave entrance, and marvelling at the
                        impressive stalagmites are a few highlights to look forward to.&nbsp;</p>
